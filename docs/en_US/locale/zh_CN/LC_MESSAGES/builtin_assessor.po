"Assessor receives the intermediate result from a trial and decides "
"whether the trial should be killed using a specific algorithm. Once the "
"trial experiment meets the early stopping conditions (which means "
"Assessor is pessimistic about the final results), the assessor will kill "
"the trial and the status of the trial will be `EARLY_STOPPED`."

"Here is an experimental result of MNIST after using the 'Curvefitting' "
"Assessor in 'maximize' mode. You can see that Assessor successfully "
"**early stopped** many trials with bad hyperparameters in advance. If you"
" use Assessor, you may get better hyperparameters using the same "
"computing resources."
