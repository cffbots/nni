"Auto tuning is one of the key features provided by NNI; a main "
"application scenario being hyper-parameter tuning. Tuning specifically "
"applies to trial code. We provide a lot of popular auto tuning algorithms"
" (called Tuner), and some early stop algorithms (called Assessor). NNI "
"supports running trials on various training platforms, for example, on a "
"local machine, on several servers in a distributed manner, or on "
"platforms such as OpenPAI, Kubernetes, etc."

"Other key features of NNI, such as model compression, feature "
"engineering, can also be further enhanced by auto tuning, which we'll "
"described when introducing those features."
