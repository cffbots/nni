"We are intensively working on both tool chain and research to make "
"automatic model design and tuning really practical and powerful. On the "
"one hand, our main work is tool chain oriented development. On the other "
"hand, our research works aim to improve this tool chain, rethink "
"challenging problems in AutoML (on both system and algorithm) and propose"
" elegant solutions. Below we list some of our research works, we "
"encourage more research works on this topic and encourage collaboration "
"with us."
